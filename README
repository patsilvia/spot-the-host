Basic
-----
A host name can be unfriendly name when it randomly generated. Besides the hostname itself, 
if a domain name part in fqdn can be more than one domain, it is pain for me to ssh to a certain specific host.
Without using the fqdn, it is nearly impossible to ssh to certain host (as because domainname part can be varied too).

This application will use bash's complete feature to help complete those crytic hostnames from a list of hostnames
that you're working with. Just simply using two tabs behind ssh.

Setup
-----

In the file spot_hosts, 
hosts="echo `cat $HOME/.ssh/myhosts`"
This line is where you locate a file that has a list of hostnames you're working with.


In the file myhosts
cat myhosts 
cse123.int.domainx.com
cse123.int.tdomainy.com
cxt783.int.wdomainy.com


Activate the completion for ssh.

$ complete -p
complete -F _plenv plenv
complete -F _rbenv rbenv

$ . spot_hosts 

$ complete -p
complete -F _plenv plenv
complete -F _ssh ssh
complete -F _rbenv rbenv

eg. 1
$ ssh cs[TAB][TAB]
It will look like this
$ ssh cs123.
cse123.int.domainx.com   cse123.int.tdomainy.com  cse123.th.superdom.com

eg. 2
$ ssh yf[TAB] --> ssh yf12.int.anotherexam.com




Fact
----
- Purposely used for mac os x. Other platform where bash works should support.
- On Mac, if you already have brew install bash-complete, this will collide with brew version's ssh completion.
